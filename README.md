My reinforcement learning projects in unity using ml-agents

1) 1v1 Shooters game, the agent shoots projectiles (delayed reward) and needs to kill the opponent shooter, feedback signals for hit or miss, consequences in reward or penalty
2) Spider vs Prey, the spider agent needs to catch the prey agent in order to reach terminal reward, the spider gets incentives for close distance to the prey and keep its up vector as the world up vector in geometric reward.
