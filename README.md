# RL Projects Unity
My reinforcement learning projects in unity using ml-agents

1) 1v1 Shooters game, the agents shoot projectiles (delayed reward) and need to kill each other, feedback signals for hit or miss, consequences in reward or penalty, in order to reach terminal reward of kill, the agents learned to collect ammo and health packs to survive longer (no rewards were given for collecting)

2) Spider vs Prey, the spider agent needs to catch the prey agent in order to reach terminal reward, the spider gets incentives for close distance to the prey and keep its up vector as the world up vector in geometric reward.
