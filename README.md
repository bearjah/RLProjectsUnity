My reinforcement learning projects in unity using ml-agents

1) 1v1 Shooters game, the agent shoots projectiles (delayed reward) and needs to kill the opponent shooter, feedback signals for hit or miss, consequences in reward or penalty
2) Spider vs Prey, the spider agent needs to catch the prey in order to reach terminal reward.
